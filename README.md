## A port of SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector to Keras framework.
Refer to [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).

- For forward pass for 300x300 model, please, follow `SSD.ipynb` for examples. 
- For training procedure for 300x300 model, please, follow `SSD_training.ipynb` for examples. 
- Moreover, in `testing_utils` folder there is a useful script to test `SSD` on video or on camera input.

- Weights are ported from the original models and are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!7RowVLCL!q3cEVRK9jyOSB9el3SssIA). You need `weights_SSD300.hdf5`, `weights_300x300_old.hdf5` is for the old version of architecture with 3x3 convolution for `pool6`.
